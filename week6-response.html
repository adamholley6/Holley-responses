	<h3 align="center"><font face="century gothic">Dave Clark and Rebekka Andersen</font></h3>
		<p>Clark and Anderson believe that technical communicators are currently more inclined to interpret technologies as just "tools", which they (Clark and Anderson) believe limits potential and reinforces how others view the abilities of technical communicators. They later propose a new way of thinking and training that would, “broaden technical communicators' possibilities as workers and researchers within organizations, and ultimately help create a more sustainable technical communication.” Clark and Anderson believe that technologies of technical communication-specific single sourcing tools are being too widely adopted, and that academics is neglecting to teach the core technology (rather than a tool that interacts with a given technology). They see XML as a skill that is growing increasingly valuable with the changes taking place in the technical communication field.

<p>The last sentence of the article summarizes how technical communication can be sustained in the future, “Sustaining the technical communication field depends on their abilities to change how they train themselves and others for the long term.” This quote shows that Clark and Anderson believe that the ability to change how people are trained, as well as what they are trained in, is the key to keeping the field of technical communication alive.</p>
