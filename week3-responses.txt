In this article, Spyridakis discusses what technical communication (TC) classrooms are currently learning and how the classroom could/should evolve in order to embrace the ever-changing, increasingly complex field of TC. Spyridakis finds an agreeable common ground between those who believe TC should be a humanistic-centered field (e.g., Miller, 1979) and those who think TC should be strictly professional (e.g., Tebeaux, 1980). I fully agree with Spyridakis’ statement, “TC programs should continue to teach foundational TC topics such as rhetoric, writing, editing, and design. But to facilitate the changing nature of the TC profession, programs may need to incorporate additional topics in the areas of genres, management and collaboration, design, UX, methods, programming, and tools”. I think that rhetoric and effective writing are essential to the foundation of TC, but I also believe that more competencies, such as collaboration and user experience (UX) should be included in technical communication classes to help students (i.e. future technical communicators) grow alongside the field in which they are a part of. 

Spyridakis researched online job ads in order to decide what topics would be most beneficial to teach students in technical communication (TC) programs.  The competencies that are currently expected of job applicants in the TC field, determined by an analysis of job online postings by Spyridakis (2015), agreed with the skills that Ramey et al. (2005) listed in their article. Although the basic competencies of collaboration, writing and editing remain in high demand, there seemed to be more emphasis on tool knowledge in Spyridakis’ findings. Spyridakis makes the point that the competencies for TC jobs are moving technical communicators closer to the field of UX. I thought it was interesting that the amount of job postings were over ten times greater when searching user designer and four times greater when searching user researcher as opposed to technical communicator. This proves the point that Spyridakis makes at the beginning of the article; that the scope of technical communication is growing to encompass other, more modern, fields. The opportunity to integrate TC studies into the field of UX is exciting to me because most user-centered jobs are in high demand right now which would be beneficial for me as I enter the workforce. 

I agree with all of the topics that Spyridakis suggests be implemented into the technical communication field of academia. Not only does she include classes like Design and Fundamentals that give TC the rhetoric based knowledge that is a necessity when conveying information, but she also calls for classes in UX and Management and Collaboration. These additional, nontraditional, courses will give students the skills they need to gain employment in the TC field. The topics discussed in this article are similar to those in the previous readings. All of the readings have discussed that the future of technical communication lies in our ability to embrace new topics in academia, primarily ones based on correspondence and other forms of client service. I’m curious to see how classes’ change in the future to meet these expectations.
