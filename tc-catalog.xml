	<course_description>
	This graduate academic certificate caters to non-majors. Teaching technical writing requires an acute attention to the stylistic and rhetorical standards and practices that govern workplace writingâ€”these practices often run counter to traditional humanities-based writing training. Understandably, these emphases are not part of the curricula in rhetoric/composition, literature, creative writing, and cultural studies programs.

	The certificate in teaching technical writing equips students with the skills needed to teach a variety of foundational courses in technical communication, including introduction to technical writing, technical editing, technical style, document and web design, and professional report and proposal writing.
