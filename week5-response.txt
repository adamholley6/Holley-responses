How does Hart-Davidson alter your perspective on a technical communicators role withen an orginization?

Hart-Davidson sets out to argue that Content Management (CM) is a collaborative effort rather than something that a single person works on. As CM grows in popularity, the roles of technical communicators grow in scope. The article states that, "we (technical communicators) are editors, information architects, usability analysts, interaction designers, project managers, client liaisons and more." Although we've discussed the change in job titles and responsibilities in class, I still think this is an interesting declaration by Hart-Davidson. All of the jobs mentioned above are critical to the business they are a part of because communication has become the main reason that companies operate.
The article talks about what a technical communicator’s job is whenever everyone in the office is responsible for writing. It then explains that our job is to format changes, edit for understanding etc. CM can be lucrative for technical communicators, given the demand for their skills. However, as the article warns that too much growth can lead to outsourcing and work fragmentation. In the end of the article, the author stresses that writing needs to be seen as a strategic activity for the entire enterprise. 

I was familiar with the majority of the topics discussed but gained additional insight after reading the article. I know that technical communicators have the potential to be valuable assets to a company, but this article explained why that potential exists. I usually think of technical communicators as being somewhat solitary, unnoticed members of an organization. I like the prospect of our positions being seen as an integral part of the work team because that most likely will affect how companies hire (and pay) technical communicators. Overall this article left me feeling hopeful for the near future of technical communicators and their position in the workplace.
